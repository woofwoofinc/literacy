Literate programming in JavaScript using [reStructuredText].

[reStructuredText]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

Detailed documentation is provided in the [src] directories and at
[woofwoofinc.github.io/literacy].

[src]: src
[woofwoofinc.github.io/literacy]: https://woofwoofinc.github.io/literacy


Installing
----------
Literacy is distributed using NPM. See the latest details at the
[Literacy NPM registry page].

[Literacy NPM registry page]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/literacy

Add it to an existing project:

    npm install --save literacy
    
Or with [Yarn]:

    yarn add literacy
    
[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com


Usage
-----
Use the `literacy` command to extract the code blocks from a single `.js.rst`
file and output to a file.

    $ literacy examples/blocks.js.rst --out-file blocks.js

The `.js.rst` or `.json.rst` files from an entire source directory can be
processed and output to another directory retaining the relative path prefixes.
This doesnâ€™t overwrite any other files or directories in the output. Use
`-out-dir` to specify an output directory.

    $ literacy --out-dir lib src

To also copy the files which are not `.js.rst` or `.json.rst` files from the
source directory to the output directory, include the `--copy-files` option.

    $ literacy --copy-files --out-dir lib src

For other command options and usage, use `--help`.

    $ literacy --help
    
    Literate programming in JavaScript using reStructured Text. This command
    extracts code blocks from `.js.rst` and `.json.rst` reStructured Text files.
    
    Usage: literacy [options] <paths>
    
    Options:
      -o, --out-file    Compile to an output file                           [string]
      -d, --out-dir     Compile to an output directory                      [string]
      -D, --copy-files  Copy non-js.rst files to output directory          [boolean]
      -s, --source-maps Generate source maps for output files              [boolean]
      -q, --quiet       Suppress messages                                  [boolean]
      -h, --help        Show help                                          [boolean]
      -v, --version     Show version number                                [boolean]

Projects which incorporate Literacy can combine documentation and source trees
into a single reStructured Text document. See [src] in this project for an
example. There, the `index.rst` file is the entry point for the documentation
and includes the source `.js.rst` files from `src/js` into the document. These
source files are also separately processed by the Literacy command line tool to
make the `lib` module directory contents for publishing to the NPM registry.


Require Hook
------------
For non-production use cases there is a require hook for including `.js.rst`
files without specifying the suffix. This can be convenient for developing in
source trees which use the `literacy` command to compile to `.js` files since
the transpilation step can be omitted.

Using a require hook in production code is not recommended practice.

To use the hook, require it from the development run harness, e.g. inside a
wrapper Yarn/NPM script.

    require('literacy/lib/register');

Then require `.js.rst` files as if they were `.js` files. The hook takes care
of intercepting the extension and performing the JavaScript code block
extraction before handing it to the Node module compiler.


Webpack Loader
--------------
A Webpack loader is provided for integrating Literacy with Webpack to support
`.js.rst` processing. See the example project included at
`example/webpack-literacy`.

See the [loader] directories or the [NPM Webpack loader] documentation for
details.

[NPM Webpack loader]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/literacy-loader


Developing
----------
The project build stack uses [Node.js] and the [Yarn] package manager. Install
these on your system if they are not already available.

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org
[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com

A [rkt] container build script is included in the project repository and
provides an installation which can be used to build the project also. See the
description on building and running the container in the Development Tools
Container section of the documentation for more information.

[rkt]: https://coreos.com/rkt

For macOS, [RktMachine] provides a CoreOS VM which supports developing using
the rkt container system.

[RktMachine]: https://github.com/woofwoofinc/rktmachine

Start by installing [Literacy] and the other project dependencies using
Yarn.

[Literacy]: https://github.com/woofwoofinc/literacy

    $ yarn

Then build the project:

    $ yarn build
