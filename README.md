Installing
----------
Literacy is distributed using NPM. See the latest details at the
[Literacy NPM registry page].

[Literacy NPM registry page]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/literacy

Add it to an existing project:

    npm install --save literacy
    
Or with [Yarn]:

    yarn add literacy
    
[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com


Usage
-----
Use the `literacy` command to extract the code blocks from a single `.js.rst`
file and output them to stdout.

    $ literacy examples/blocks.js.rst

Multiple file paths and even directories can be specified in the command line.

    $ literacy examples/blocks.js.rst examples/basic.js.rst src

To output to a file, use `--out-file`.

    $ literacy examples/blocks.js.rst --out-file blocks.js

The `.js.rst` files from an entire source directory can be processed and output
to another directory retaining the relative path prefixes. This doesnâ€™t
overwrite any other files or directories in the output. Use `-out-dir` to
specify an output directory.

    $ literacy --out-dir lib src

To also copy the files which are not `.js.rst` files from the source directory
to the output directory, include the `--copy-files` option.

    $ literacy --copy-files --out-dir lib src

For other command options and usage, use `--help`.

    $ literacy --help
